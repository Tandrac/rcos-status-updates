What I did this week: Started getting my environment set up, downloaded the
newest version of github desktop, forked the runelite repo, and downloaded
IntelliJ.

What I plan on doing next: I still have to finalize my environment, then I have to
start learning how the app actually runs/ how I'm able to modify it.

Blockers: Having some issues finalizing my IntelliJ setup, but I think that's
due to outdated wiki instructions, gonna mess with Maven a bit and get it running.
