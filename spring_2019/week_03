What I did this week: Finally got my build working, I had to install some random
plugins that allowed the build to use log's. I also began digging through the
files to get a sense of how the project actually builds, and how I can add to that.

What I plan on doing next: My goal for next week is to begin creating a test template
that would allow me to work out how to actually affect the client. My medium-ish tier
goal for this is to incorporate a "power mining" tool that would allow users to
effectively mine without wasting downtime between rocks, and to streamline the
decision making required.

Blockers: None ATM
