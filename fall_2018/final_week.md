What I did: I did implement the friendly camera vision, but adding enemy camera vision proved to be much more difficult,
as for whatever reason the enemy vision cone and camera refused to synch up, meaning that the enemies camera would give vision to enemy units without the enemy camera being in the same room as the friendly troops.

Reflections: So this was an interesting semester of RCOS, as it was the first time I (a cs student) have worked on a game,
which seems to be both a surprise to a lot of people. Unfortunately (or fortunately if you're an optimist like me),
this has reaffirmed my believe that I shouldn't be a game dev. While some aspects of the project were quite interesting
(like planning out and collaboratively writing pseudo code for stuff like the vision cones), much of the project work ended up being either creating art assets, or fighting with unity to actually move, combine, and implement assets in the game.
All is not gloom however, as even though not all the aspects of the project were enjoyable, they were, (almost, I still don't understand gimp, like at all), all educational.

For example, this was my first time using c#, so basically everything was a learning experience on that end.
In addition, just using unity myself has given me much more appreciation for the games that are successfully developed and released using the engine. Also, while my art is still pretty objectively terrible, I got more "efficient" (if you want to call it that) at creating and importing it. Finally, and probably most importantly, this project was a great experience in working on a project with truly diversified roles.

In my previous RCOS group, we all had different assignments for the project, but each roll wasn't that diverse as we all had similar general tasks (like front end ect..). This project was different however, as working on art was totally different than designing the game, which was totally different from writing c#, which was also different from combining unity assets.

All and all, I'd say that this project was a success, we actually finished our end-of-semester deliverables and have a working game, if quite basic. In addition, the project was also quite the learning experience as described before.

A successful semester :)
