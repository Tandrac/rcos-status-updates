What I did: Finished the art assets I was working on, adding the power box and updated camera

What I'm going to do: Update camera model to include vision cone, allowing players to access friendly cameras vision.
As a stretch goal, I'm going to try and possible add enemy cameras that will provide actionable vision for them.
A stretch-stretch goal is to add a way to flip camera control from enemy to friendly.

Blockers: Unity is for whatever reason really finicky about the way that the prefabs are created when joining separate but already made assets.
