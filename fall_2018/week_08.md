What I did: Worked on presentation, and presented. It went well, so I'm glad we worked on it as a group.

What I'm going to do: Probably nothing over thanksgiving, but if I can, Working on adding more art assets, making a game takes waaay more art than I expected, basically everything required unique art.

Blockers: Making a game is pretty vague, so finding direction can be difficult.
